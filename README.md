# Follow the instructions to run the application

  If you don't have node.js installed, make sure to do it first (Linux)
  ```
  sudo apt-get install nodejs
  ```
  ```
  sudo apt-get install npm
  ```

  Then you can setup the project in your local

  ```
  npm install
  ```
  ```
  bower install
  ```

  To execute the UI project in your local box you have to run the grunt command
  
  ```
  grunt server
  ```
  
  This command will compile the entire project, run the express server
  and watch for any changes to restart the process.

  In your browser of preference, run the following address to see Mobiquity F1 UI.
  ```
  localhost:1337/
  ```
